# Journey into React
The project files for the Journey into React tutorial that I'm writing on my website, davidmeents.com. It is still in development and will be released shortly.

### Part Three: Creating your first React App
Hello and welcome back for part 3 of our journey into React. By now, you've set up your windows based work environment, and have created your first hello world app. If you've missed these, I'd highly recommend going back and reviewing them: part 1 is here, and part 2 is here.

Today we are going to be expanding on this hello world app to start to fit the needs of the end application we'll be building. In review, we are working on an address book application that is going to store our contacts in a Mongo database. Our application will support multiple accounts, will authenticate securely, and will provide us with the ability to add, erase, call, or email our contacts all from within the browser. So going forward we are going to start pushing our application in that direction.

### Part Two: Creating your first React App
In part 1 of our journey into react we got our windows work environment set up; we installed ConEmu to set up a pretty windows console, the text editor Atom.io to improve our coding experience, and then from within that console we installed Node.js and git. After that we learned how to navigate using the command line, and we created our project directory, and initialized our project with the npm init command. Lastly, we got a feel for how installing dependencies works by installing React itself.

In this part of our tutorial we'll get a working development server set up, and our first hello world app to display in the web browser. To do this we are going to install several new dependencies, set up our webpack.config file, and of course get our first taste of programming in React. So let's dive right in!

### Part One: Getting Started with React on Windows
After recently taking the plunge into React myself, I decided I would write a series of posts on my experience. I found that while there are countless well written articles on the subject, tutorials to follow, and the endless knowledge of professionals on Stack Overflow, getting a working knowledge of React was difficult and the process was convoluted. It's my hope that that this series of articles and their accompanying videos will make the learning curve a bit easier, and get you creating much faster.

I went into learning this language with a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JQUERY, as well as experience in C#. Even with this experience I initially found the concepts of React, Node, and all of their dependencies a bit overwhelming, so stick with it and you'll be creating your own apps in no time.
