### Part One: Getting Started with React on Windows
After recently taking the plunge into React myself, I decided I would write a series of posts on my experience. I found that while there are countless well written articles on the subject, tutorials to follow, and the endless knowledge of professionals on Stack Overflow, getting a working knowledge of React was difficult and the process was convoluted. It's my hope that that this series of articles and their accompanying videos will make the learning curve a bit easier, and get you creating much faster.

I went into learning this language with a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JQUERY, as well as experience in C#. Even with this experience I initially found the concepts of React, Node, and all of their dependencies a bit overwhelming, so stick with it and you'll be creating your own apps in no time.
